# Planner
A go-to reminder on how to plan and build my projects. Found inspiration from Peter Lunch on dev.to and his personal blog

STEP 1: Define the project
  a. What is the project?
  b. What is the MVP (Minimal Viable Product)? => Which features are essential to make the product purposeful
  c. What are the nice to haves
  d. When will the project be complete?
  
  
STEP 2: Create Workflow
  a. Choose a methodology. e.g. Kanban, Agile, Waterfall
  Kanban (Item List may vary):
    TODO
    Doing
    Done
    Bugs
    
    
STEP 3: Break project down into small components
  a. Break each component into smaller checklist
  

STEP 4: Start Building and Do not fear!!!
